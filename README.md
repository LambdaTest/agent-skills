## Getting Started

[TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/) (Formerly LambdaTest) is the world's first full-stack AI Agentic Quality Engineering platform that empowers teams to test intelligently, smarter, and ship faster. Built for scale, it offers a full-stack testing cloud with 10K+ real devices and 3,000+ browsers. With AI-native test management, MCP servers, and agent-based automation, TestMu AI supports Selenium, Appium, Playwright, and all major frameworks. 

With TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest), you can install production-grade Agent Skills for every major test automation framework across 15+ languages, enabling AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, and Gemini CLI to write expert-level test automation code.

- [Sign up on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/register/) (Formerly LambdaTest).
- Follow the [TestMu AI Documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/) for the full setup walkthrough.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (latest stable) — required to run `npx agentskillsforall`
- An AI coding assistant (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or similar)
- A TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) account with your username and access key

### Setup

Clone and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills && cd agent-skills
npx agentskillsforall add https://github.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills.git
```

Set your credentials as environment variables.

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**Windows:**

```bash
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

### Run tests

Install a specific skill and use it with your AI assistant:

```bash
# Install a specific skill
npx agentskillsforall add https://github.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills.git --skill selenium-skill
npx agentskillsforall add https://github.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills.git --skill playwright-skill
npx agentskillsforall add https://github.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills.git --skill cypress-skill

# Browse all available skills
npx agentskillsforall list https://github.com/LambdaTest/agent-skills.git
```

Then ask your AI assistant naturally:

```
"Write Playwright tests for the login page and run them on TestMu AI cloud (Chrome + Firefox)"
"Create JUnit 5 tests for the payments service with Mockito and GitHub Actions CI"
```

View results on your TestMu AI dashboard.

### Local testing with TestMu AI Tunnel

To test locally hosted apps, set up the TestMu AI tunnel. OS-specific guides:

- [Local Testing on Windows](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-windows/)
- [Local Testing on macOS](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-macos/)
- [Local Testing on Linux](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-linux/)

Add the following to your capabilities:

```js
tunnel: true,
```

## LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

On **January 12, 2026**, [LambdaTest evolved to TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/), the world's first fully autonomous **Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform**.

Same team. Same infrastructure. Same customer accounts. All existing LambdaTest logins, scripts, capabilities, and integrations continue to work without change.

### How LambdaTest Evolved into TestMu AI

In 2017, we launched LambdaTest with a simple mission: make testing fast, reliable, and accessible. As LambdaTest grew, we expanded into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the full depth of the testing lifecycle.

As software development entered the AI era, testing had to evolve, too. We rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up, with autonomous agents that **plan, author, execute, analyze, and optimize tests** while keeping humans in the loop. The platform integrates with your repos, CI, IDEs, and terminals, continuously learning from every code change and development signal.

That evolution earned a new name: **TestMu AI**, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering. TestMu is not a new name for us. It is the name of our annual community conference, which has brought together 100,000+ quality engineers to discuss how AI would reshape testing, long before that became an industry norm. 

What started as a high-performance cloud testing platform has transformed into an AI-native, multi-agent system powering a connected, end-to-end quality layer. That evolution defined a new identity: LambdaTest evolved into TestMu AI, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering.
